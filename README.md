# CS47C: Completion of Work in Computer Science 61C (Fall 2023, UCB)

This repository contains coursework from **CS61C: Great Ideas of Computer Architecture**, which I took in Fall 2023 at UC Berkeley. The course is a self-paced version of 61C (Great Ideas of Computer Architecture) for students who have already taken a course equivalent to 61C. The course explores fundamental concepts in computer architecture, including the structure of processors, memory systems, and assembly language programming.

## Contents:

- **Labs**: Contains lab assignments that focus on hands-on experience with assembly language programming, memory hierarchy, and hardware simulation.
- **Homework**: Includes homework assignments covering topics like digital logic, CPU design, memory architecture, and parallelism.

## Key Concepts Covered:

- **Assembly Language**: Writing and understanding low-level programs using MIPS assembly language.
- **CPU Design**: The structure and design of processors, including the fetch-decode-execute cycle.
- **Memory Hierarchy**: Understanding caches, virtual memory, and memory management.
- **Parallelism**: Techniques for parallel processing and the architecture supporting it.
- **Digital Logic**: Basics of digital circuits, including gates, multiplexers, and flip-flops.

## How to Navigate:

- **Labs**: All lab assignments are located under the `Labs/` directory, each containing MIPS assembly code, hardware design exercises, and simulations.
- **Homework**: The `Homework/` directory contains problem sets and solutions that dive into computer architecture topics like CPU performance and memory systems.


Explore the coursework to see how computer architecture concepts are applied in practice, including low-level programming with assembly, CPU design, and parallelism.
